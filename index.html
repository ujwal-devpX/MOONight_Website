                        <h1>MUFFINS</h1>
                        <p>Muffins are small, baked goods that resemble cupcakes but have a denser, bread-like texture. They can be sweet or savory and are often enjoyed as a breakfast item or snack. Common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, baking powder, and milk. Sweet muffins come in various flavors like blueberry, chocolate chip, banana, and cinnamon, while savory versions may include cheese, corn, or vegetables.

                            Muffins are usually baked in a muffin tin, giving them their signature round shape with a domed top. They are quick and easy to prepare, making them a popular homemade treat. Unlike cupcakes, muffins are less sweet and don‚Äôt usually have frosting.
                            
                            The origin of muffins dates back to 18th-century England, where they were cooked on griddles. Today, they are widely available in bakeries, coffee shops, and supermarkets. Muffins can be customized with nuts, dried fruits, or spices for added flavor.</p>
